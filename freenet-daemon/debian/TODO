- have a /usr/bin/freenet so users can run freenet "directly" from the jar
- use debuild or git-buildpackage to build source packages rather than our own custom code
- currently, tests are run twice
- split arch-dependent JNI libs out of JAR files
- use a systemd service instead of inid.d
- wrapper (3.5.20) needs to be updated to current debian version (3.5.22) so we dont package our own
- bouncycastle in debian repo needs to be updated to version 1.52
- /var/run/freenet maybe needs to be moved.
- package the external libs properly so that we can get rid of the ant-contrib dependency

- fred: program directories need to be put in a new section in the freenet config.
- split wrapper.conf up
